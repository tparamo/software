INSTALLATION ERRORS? :
/////////////////////////////

1. Compilation error?

Did you make GROMACS accesible by using its installation script?

source your-installation-prefix-here/bin/GMXRC

(http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Installation_Instructions)

You didn't and you dont want to do it? Then go to the Makefile and change LDFLAGS and CFLAGS:

LDFLAGS: argument -L needs the path to the folder where the library libgmx is located (libgmx.a/libgmx.so)

CFLAGS: argument -I needs the path to the folder where libgmx libary headers are (.h files); tipically located in
a include/gromacs folder


2. If you get the error:

"error while loading shared libraries: libgmx.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

It is because the system doesn't know where libgmx is. Then you will need to update LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

For example: 
bash: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$GMXLDLIB"
tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GMXLDLIB}

3. Now it should work!
