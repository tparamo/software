//////////////////////////////
Pre-requisite
//////////////////////////////
trj_cavity depends on GROMACS, therefore GROMACS (any version) must be previously installed in your computer. 
You can download it from:

http://www.gromacs.org/Downloads

/////////////////////////////
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS :
/////////////////////////////

1. Modify the variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in the Makefile to point to your gromacs libaries:

LDFLAGS: argument -L needs the path to the folder where the library libgmx is located (libgmx.a/libgmx.so)

CFLAGS: argument -I needs the path to the folder where libgmx libary headers are (.h files); tipically located in 
a include/gromacs folder

2. Compile it.

>make

3. Run it

>./trj_cavity

If you get the error:

"error while loading shared libraries: libgmx.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

It is because the system doesn't know where libgmx is. Then you will need to update LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

For example: 
bash: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/mary/software/gromacs-4.6.3/build/src/gmxlib"
tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/mary/software/gromacs-4.6.3/build/src/gmxlib

Now it should work!

4. For help

>./trj_cavity -h
